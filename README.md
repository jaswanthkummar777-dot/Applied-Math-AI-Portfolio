# Applied Mathematics & AI Portfolio

This repository contains selected projects demonstrating my
interest and preparation in applied mathematics, data analysis,
and introductory artificial intelligence.

The work focuses on applying mathematical concepts such as
statistics, regression, and logical reasoning to practical
AI-based problems using Python.

This portfolio is intended to support my undergraduate
applications in Artificial Intelligence / Data Science.
